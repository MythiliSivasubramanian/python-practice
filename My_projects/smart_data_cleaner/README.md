Project:    Smart Data Cleaner & Analyzer (Core Python)
Date: 8 January 2026

Problem Statement:

In real world, we often work with messy, incomplete (missing values) or unformatted data with inconsistent cases, extra spaces, duplicate. 

This project focuses on cleaning a raw Student dataset using core Python, so that the cleaned data can be used for further Analysis and visualization.

What this Project does:

1.	Reads the student raw data from a text file. The Raw file consist of 1000 records with the 
    following fields Name, Subject, Marks, Year.
    (Raw data file name: raw_data.txt) 
2.	Cleans and normalizes the data with consistent casing and removing unnecessary spaces. 
3.	Removes duplicate records after proper normalization.
4.	Handles missing or incomplete data safely using appropriate default values.
5.	Sorts student records in ascending order and assigns sequential roll numbers
6.	Produces a clean, formatted output text file with the following fields:
    First_Name, Last_Name, Roll_No, Subject, Marks, Result, Year.
