# Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**.
This repository contains Python programs I have written while learning step-by-step, from basics to mini projects.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `01_Basics` | Input/output, variables, data types, type casting, and simple math problems. |
| `02_IfElse` | Conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested conditions, and logical operators. |
| `03_Loops` | `for`/`while` loops, nested loops, pattern problems, and control flow. |
| `04_Functions` | Functions with parameters, return values, recursion basics, and reusable logic. |
| `05_Lists` | List operations, indexing/slicing, comprehensions, sorting, and list-based practice tasks. |
| `06_Dictionaries` | Dictionary creation, updates, deletions, loops, comprehensions, and nested dictionaries. |
| `07_Sets` | Set creation, union/intersection/difference, subset checks, and deduplication use cases. |
| `07_02_Tuples` | Tuple basics, indexing/slicing, packing/unpacking, and comparison/sorting usage. |
| `08_Strings` | String methods, slicing, formatting, cleaning, counting, and transformation practice. |
| `09_File_Handling` | File modes, read/write operations, `with` statement, CSV and JSON basics. |
| `10_Exception_Handling` | Topic folder created (README-level notes currently). |
| `11_Modules_Packages` | Topic folder created (README-level notes currently). |

## Concepts Covered So Far
- Input/output and variables
- Data types and type casting
- Arithmetic and comparison operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Tuples
- Strings
- Basic file handling
- Utility scripts and mini project practice

---

## Current Focus
- Strengthening problem-solving with cleaner Python code
- Building mini projects and utility scripts
- Organizing projects with better structure and documentation

---

## Next Goals
- Add implementations in `10_Exception_Handling`
- Add implementations in `11_Modules_Packages`
- Start core exercises in `12_OOP`
- Practice `13_Iterators_Generators` and `14_Functional_Programming`
- Expand `My_projects` with end-to-end practical scripts
