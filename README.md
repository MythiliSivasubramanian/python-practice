#  Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 
This repository contains all the Python programs I’ve written while learning step-by-step — from basic syntax to advanced logic, with plenty of examples and practice challenges.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Basics` | Basic input/output, variables, and simple math. |
| `IfElse` | Conditional statements — learning `if`, `elif`, and `else`. |
| `Dictionaries` |  Creation — Adding / Updating elements, Accessing Elements — Deleting - Fundamentals, Copying, nested dictionaries, Adavntages, disadvantages  |
| `Loops` |  Practice with `for` and `while` loops. |
| `Lists` |  Working with lists — adding, removing, and iterating through items. |
| `Functions` |  Creating reusable functions with parameters and return values. |
| `Memory_Logic` |  Understanding various methods and functions on Strings |
| `Sets` |  Fundamentals | Set Operations  | Set comprehensions  | Frozenset (immutable sets)  | Performance comparisons (list vs set)  |
| `String_Practice` |  Understanding variable references, copies, and how Python stores data in memory. |
| `String_List` |  Pratcie problems on various String and List datatypes. |
| `Projects` |  Mini projects combining multiple Python concepts (calculators, analyzers, etc.). |
| `Utility_Scripts` |  Various small programs on multiple Python ultilities . |

##  Next Steps
I’m currently working on:
-  Sets
-  Tuples  
-  File Handling 
-  Automation basics

##  About This Repo
This repository serves as my **learning log and practice ground** for mastering Python fundamentals from scratch.  
My goal: to build strong foundations and move toward practical projects, automation, and data analysis.

###  Current Focus:
Improving foundations with functions and building small real-world projects.

###  Next Goals:
- Add more function challenges  
- Start M7_Projects  
- Document learning steps for each project
