# 🐍 Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 👩‍💻✨  
This repository contains all the Python programs I’ve written while learning step-by-step — from basic syntax to advanced logic, with plenty of examples and practice challenges.

## 📚 Folder Structure

| Folder Name   | Description |

| **M1_Basics**    | 🧩 Basic input/output, variables, simple math, and string operations. |
| **M2_IfElse**    | ⚖️ Conditional statements — practicing decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. |
| **M3_Loops**     | 🔁 Working with `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions and handle conditions dynamically. |
| **M4_Lists**     | 📋 Operations with lists — adding, removing, summing items, etc. |
| **M5_Functions** | 🧠 Programs with `def`, arguments, `return`, and modular logic. Includes validation, arithmetic, and condition-based tasks. |                                            | **M5_Memory**    | 📋 Lessons on mutable vs immutable, copy vs reference |
| **M6_Projects**  | 🏁 Mini projects that combine multiple concepts |
