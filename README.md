# 🐍 Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 👩‍💻✨  
This repository contains all the Python programs I’ve written while learning step-by-step — from basic syntax to advanced logic, with plenty of examples and practice challenges.

## 📚 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `M1_Basics` | 🧩 Basic input/output, variables, and simple math. |
| `M2_IfElse` | ⚖️ Conditional statements — learning `if`, `elif`, and `else`. |
| `M3_Loops` | 🔁 Practice with `for` and `while` loops. |
| `M4_Lists` | 📋 Working with lists — adding, removing, and iterating through items. |
| `M5_Functions` | 🧮 Creating reusable functions with parameters and return values. |
| `M6_Memory_Logic` | 🧠 Understanding variable references, copies, and how Python stores data in memory. |
| `M7_Projects` | 💼 Mini projects combining multiple Python concepts (calculators, analyzers, etc.). |


## 🧠 Concepts Covered So Far
- 🏁 Input / Output and variables  
- 🔢 Data types and typecasting
