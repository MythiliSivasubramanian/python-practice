#  Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 
This repository contains all the Python programs I’ve written while learning step-by-step — from basic syntax to advanced logic, with plenty of examples and practice challenges.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `01_Basics`                 | Basic input/output, variables, data types, type casting, and simple math operations.                                                   |
| `02_IfElse`                 | Conditional statements — learning `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested conditions, and logical operators.                                      |
| `03_Loops`                  | Practice with `for` and `while` loops, nested loops, `break`, `continue`, and loop patterns.                                           |
| `04_Functions`              | Creating reusable functions with parameters, return values, default arguments, recursion, and lambda basics.                           |
| `05_Lists`                  | Working with lists — indexing, slicing, adding, removing, sorting, copying, nested lists, and list comprehensions.                     |
| `06_Dictionaries`           | Creation, adding/updating elements, accessing & deleting, looping, copying, nested dictionaries, advantages & disadvantages.           |
| `07_Sets`                   | Fundamentals, set operations (union, intersection, difference), set comprehensions, `frozenset`, performance comparison (list vs set). |
| `08_Strings`                | String operations, slicing, methods, immutability, memory references, formatting, and practice problems on string & list logic.        |
| `09_File_Handling`          | File open modes, reading methods, writing/appending, CSV handling, JSON basics, and log/text processing scripts.                       |
| `10_Exception_Handling`     | Error handling using `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`, multiple exceptions, and custom exceptions.                                   |
| `11_Modules_Packages`       | Importing modules, creating custom modules, `__name__ == "__main__"`, package structure, and code reuse.                               |
| `12_OOP`                    | Object-Oriented Programming — classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.                   |
| `13_Iterators_Generators`   | Iterators, `__iter__`, `__next__`, generators, `yield`, and memory-efficient looping.                                                  |
| `14_Functional_Programming` | Lambda functions, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and functional coding patterns.                                                           |
| `15_Utility_Scripts`        | Small automation tools — file renamers, log cleaners, password generators, etc.                                                        |
| `16_Mini_Projects`          | Mini projects combining multiple Python concepts (calculators, analyzers, automation tools, etc.).                                     |
