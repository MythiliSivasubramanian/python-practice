# 🐍 Python Practice by Mythili Sivasubramanian

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 👩‍💻✨  
This repository contains all the Python programs I’ve written while learning step-by-step — from basic syntax to advanced logic, with plenty of examples and practice challenges.

---

## 📚 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `M1_Basics` | 🧩 Basic input/output, variables, and simple math. |
| `M2_IfElse` | ⚖️ Conditional statements — learning `if`, `elif`, and `else`. |
| `M3_Loops` | 🔁 Practice with `for` and `while` loops. |
| `M4_Lists` | 📋 Working with lists — adding, removing, and iterating through items. |
| `M5_Functions` | 🧮 Creating reusable functions with parameters and return values. |
| `M6_Memory_Logic` | 🧠 Understanding variable references, copies, and how Python stores data in memory. |
| `M7_Projects` | 💼 Mini projects combining multiple Python concepts (calculators, analyzers, etc.). |


## 🧠 Concepts Covered So Far
- 🏁 Input / Output and variables  
- 🔢 Data types and typecasting  
- ➕ Arithmetic and comparison operators  
- ⚙️ Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- 📋 Lists and indexing  
- 🧩 Functions and return values  
- ⚠️ Exception handling (`try` / `except`)  
- 💬 f-strings and formatted printing  

---

## 🌟 Next Steps
I’m currently working on:
- 🧮 List operations and comprehension  
- 📊 Dictionaries and tuples  
- 🧠 Small projects (mini calculator, quiz, password generator, etc.)  
- 🌐 Automation basics

## 💖 About This Repo
This repository serves as my **learning log and practice ground** for mastering Python fundamentals from scratch.  
My goal: to build strong foundations and move toward practical projects, automation, and data analysis.

## ✅ Learning Progress Tracker

Here’s my Python learning journey, tracked module by module!  
Each module builds upon the previous one, from fundamentals to practical projects. 🚀

| Module | Topic | Status | Key Concepts Covered |
|---------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| 🧩 **M1_Basics** | Variables, Input/Output, Simple Math | ✅ Completed | `print()`, `input()`, arithmetic operators |
| ⚖️ **M2_IfElse** | Conditional Statements | ✅ Completed | `if`, `elif`, `else`, logical operators |
| 🔁 **M3_Loops** | For & While Loops | ✅ Completed | `for`, `while`, `range()`, counters |
| 📋 **M4_Lists** | Lists & Iterations | ✅ Completed | `append()`, `len()`, iteration, indexing |
| 🧮 **M5_Functions** | Functions & Return Values | ✅ In Progress | `def`, `return`, parameters, unpacking |
| 🧠 **M6_Memory_Logic** | Variable References & Memory | 🔜 Upcoming | Mutable vs Immutable, reference vs copy |
| 💼 **M7_Projects** | Mini Projects | 🔜 Upcoming | Calculator, List Analyzer, Number Games |

---

### 🗓️ Current Focus:
Improving foundations with functions and building small real-world projects.

### 🎯 Next Goals:
- Add more function challenges  
- Start M7_Projects  
- Document learning steps for each project
