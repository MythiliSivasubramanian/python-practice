This folder has small examples and exercises all about working with strings in Python.

The files are roughly grouped by difficulty so you can see what to try first,
what comes next, and what’s a little harder:

**Basic**

These scripts mostly use simple indexing, slicing, membership tests and basic
methods. They’re a good warm‑up for someone just learning about text.

- `string_operations.py` – a few short demos of concatenation, repetition, etc.
- `count_of_specific_char_in_string.py`, `no_of_times_of_character.py`
- `charachters_count_without_len().py` – manual length calculation
- `no_of_words_string.py`, `check_words_in_strings.py`
- `extract_1st_last_char.py`, `reverse_word_order.py`, `palindrome.py`
- `count_words_starting_with_vowel.py`, `count_words_starting_with_vowels.py`
- `remove_vowels_manual.py`, `replace_spaces.py`
- `count_upper_lower.py`

**Intermediate**

These exercises introduce more methods, splitting/joining, basic parsing,
and small algorithms.

- `anagrams.py`, `vowels_consonants_count.py`
- `location_size_strings.py`, `extract_2nd_word.py`
- `formatting_fstring_decimal_values.py`
- `remove_non_alpha.py`, `Remove_non_alpha_chars.py`
- `remove_duplicates_keep_last_occurrence.py`
- `name_clearner.py`, `reverse_word_loop.py`
- `toolkit.py` – a collection of handy string functions

**Advanced**

Only one file for now. It steps up the challenge a bit by using regular
descriptions (with `re`) to clean text. Take a peek when you feel ready for
something a little different.

- `remove_non_alpha_characters.py` – strips out anything that isn't A–Z or
a–z using the `re` module.

(Feel free to move a file between groups as you gain confidence – the
classification is informal.)

The code is written for beginners but grows gradually; read, run and tweak the
examples to learn at your own pace.

Enjoy exploring Python text!
